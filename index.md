## Introduction {#Introduction}

This page offers guidance to owners of websites and mobile applications to describe the accessibility of their website or mobile application in an Accessibility Statement.

<!--

## Purpose {#Purpose}

This guide and tool helps owners of websites and mobile applications to describe the accessibility of their products and services. The resulting accessibility statements are for people with disabilities, to get an understanding of the accessibility and where to get information or leave feedback.

## Introduction {#Introduction}
This page lists and describes the information that can be added to an accessibility statement. The purpose of this accessibility statement is to support consistent reporting of the accessibility of websites and mobile applications. It provides a model that will help and guide owners of websites and mobile applications who wish to publish an accessibility statement on their website or mobile application. The reason for a statement can be organizational, local, or national requirements like the EU Directive 2016/2102 in Europe. A reason could also be the wish of an organization to provide harmonized accessibility information to the public. The model accessibility statement is aligned with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#conformance">authoritative interpretation of WCAG</a> and with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#step5c">step 5c of WCAG-EM</a>.

With an accessibility statement, the owner of a website can explain how their website or mobile application conforms to WCAG. The statement also informs visitors about accessible alternatives for (temporarily) inaccessible content. The accessibility statement also provides users with information and a link to a feedback mechanism.

The accessibility statement can (optionally) be used to describe other measures taken to promote accessibility of the website or mobile application and to report on additional organizational, local, or national requirements for the statement. For this reason, the model accessibility statement on this page consists of minimal and optional elements. The minimal  elements are those required by WCAG and WCAG-EM. The optional elements may include additional measures or information as a result of organizational or other (legal) requirements or policies. The owner of a website or mobile application may also consider adding additional information concerning their accessibility.

### Audience

The primary audience for this resource are persons who need to create an accessibility statement. These can be owners of websites and mobile applications, or those responsible for the website or mobile application. Providing an accessibility statement could be voluntarily or required. The requirement could be from the organization itself, from procurers, from researchers, or from a broader initiative such as the EU Directive etc. The guidance on this page provides them with an internationally harmonized model to generate an accessibility statement, including an example for the page markup.
	
An important audience for the accessibility statement are users with disabilities. They may find information about accessible alternatives, accessibility support and/or information about where they can provide input and/or feedback on the accessibility of a website or mobile application. They will also benefit from a harmonized and consistent model.

### Levels of guidance

This resource offers guidance for different objectives:
Description of elements that can be part of an accessibility statement
Minimal model accessibility statement
Comprehensive model accessibility statement

The minimal and comprehensive model accessibility statements also provide a 'datamodel' comparable to the model produced in WCAG-EM to help harmonize consistent reporting.

## List and description of elements {#Listofelements}

This section contains a list of potential elements that can be included in an Accessibility Statement for a website or mobile application. Every element has a short explanation, one or more examples and a proposed dataformat. Anyone setting up an Accessibility Statement can use any of these elements. Section 'minimal example' and section 'comprehensive example' provide examples of a minimal and a comprehensive Accessibility Statement. <strong>Comment:</strong> The textareas and buttons are there for discussion only.

### Enforcement procedure
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
* If you have an enforcement procedure then add a description and if available a link here. An example of an enforcement procedure is to describe what will happen when a person sends in feedback.

{% include excol.html type="start" id="Compliance_basis_input" %}
### Compliance basis
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
* Where does the requirement to be conformant originate from (organization, legal requirement, other motivation). This could be a non-public statement, for example if a company requires their departments to report on compliance to a central unit/department.
* <strong>Example:</strong> If this is not public, but as an internal requirement from a top department in the organization, an example  could be: "Required by department X for compliance". If required by law to report like in Europe, it could be: "Directive 2016/2102 of the European Union" or in the US: "ADA". It could also be local legislation like "WGBH/cz" in the Netherlands. For Citylights, the example could be "Our organization supports is committed to the promoting a high degree of usability for people with disabilities. Our management requires involvement of different stakeholders in Web accessibility. These include disability organizations, accessibility research organizations, and more. We also want to follow legal rquirements."
* <strong>Format:</strong> [Describe the compliance basis]
* <textarea rows="1" cols="50">Explain why your organization strives for conformance...</textarea><button type="button">Add to my Accessibility Statement</button>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}

<!--
### Quality assurance method used
* The quality assurance method used (WCAG-EM, internal QA, other)
* <strong>Example:</strong> [to be written]
* <textarea rows="1" cols="50">Add qualtity assurance method used...</textarea><button type="button">Add to my Accessibility Statement</button>
-->

{% include excol.html type="start" id="Intention_organization_input" %}
### Intention of the organization
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
* The intention could be to reach a higher level of conformance or to work on full conformance of all websites and mobile apps. It also describes the manner in which digital accessibility is embedded in the organization's policy.
* <strong>Example:</strong> The website within the scope of this Accessibility Statement is now WCAG2.0 AAA conformant but we are planning to implement WCAG2.1 AAA Success Criteria to the website within the next year.
* <strong>Format:</strong> [Description of the intention of the organization]
* <textarea rows="1" cols="50">Add information about the intention of the organization regarding accessibility..</textarea><button type="button">Add to my Accessibility Statement</button>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" id="Conformance_measures_input" %}
### Conformance Measures
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
* Add conformance measures to the element ‘remarks and explanation’. For every non-conformity identified, describe the measures that will be taken and the schedule that indicates when those measures are put into effect. This can be added to the table as a seperate column. This information is important for persons with disabilities to understand what the organization will do to repair non-conformities and when they can expect this to work. These non-conformities can also be beyond the required conformity level (the organization may want to apply AAA Success criteria while this is not required by law or by procurers).
* <strong>Format:</strong> Add [Description of the conformance measures] as a column to the table in ‘remarks and explanation’ or add a separate section named "conformance measures"
* <strong>Example:</strong> Not applicable because our Citylights website is already conformant with WCAG2.0 AAA.
<button type="button">Add conformance measures to the table (results) or add separate section</button><button type="button">Add seperate section about conformance measures</button>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" id="Organizational_measures_input" %}
### Organisational measures
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
* Measures implemented to achieve sustainable accessibility like procurement actions, training, raising awareness, QA, etc.
* <strong>Example:</strong> Our organization has added web accessibility to our procurement requirements. We also train our staff in web accessibility once a year. The accessibility of web and mobile application is also part of our Quality Assurance method and included in our ISO 9001 procedures.
* <strong>Format:</strong> [Description of organizational measures]
* <textarea rows="1" cols="50">Has your organization taken measures to achieve accessibility...</textarea><button type="button">Add to my Accessibility Statement</button>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" id="Formal_confirmation_input" %}
### Formal confirmation
{% include excol.html type="middle" %}
* Formal confirmation on management level of the timeliness and the correctness of the Accessibility Statement, and confirmation that the designated administrator or other responsible person or function formally agrees with the content of the Accessibility Statement by the organization.
* <strong>Example:</strong> This could look like: "This Accessibility Statement is approved by the Communication Department of Citylights (July 2018)" or Approved by the Citylights Accessibility Department"
* <strong>Format:</strong> Approved by [name/department];[function]
* <textarea rows="1" cols="50">Approved by Hannibal, Director A-Team of Citylights</textarea><button type="button">Add to my Accessibility Statement</button>
{% include excol.html type="end" %}
