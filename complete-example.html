        <h3>Conformance status</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> have three conformance levels: A, AA, and AAA. These guidelines provide criteria to make the content more accessible for people with disabilities and improve the user experience for everyone.

        <h4>Additions to the requirements</h4>
        <p>Although our goal is WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance, we have also applied some Level AAA Success Criteria: Images of text are only used for decorative purposes. Re-authentication after a session expires does not cause loss of data. Some videos have sign language interpretation.</p>
